Hi Everyone. This is Julian Frank

For quite some time I've been blogging my experiments on julianfrank.wordpress.com but this time I wanted to move to video blog...so here we are...

I recently tried out the Amazon Container Service and the copilot cli which is the companion cli to help with this solution. 

Lets go about this today but first a quick background on why I'm interested in this?

Back in 2016 I had blogged about Hobby stack that could be built by individuals to build their own web places You can see the link in the description. 

So what is Hobby stack?

> Hobby Stack Slide

Its a stack that I beleive can be used by the not so normal developers to build their own place without any regard for the "Enterprise" model and norms. 

Focus has to be on Cool Features, almost zero cost, cloud independent and multi-cloud resilient. 

Most of these would would have low traffic volume and not have commercial value but focus would be on not-so-normal architecture design patterns and user experiences

Over the years the option available have increased making this a very interesting "Hobby" for me.

Off late I've been playing around with functions provided by different clouds and slowly and steadily I'm seeing "container serverless" slowly becoming more and more mature every year. 

This is not a new solution ...Its been around for more than 5 years! Also Copilot is also not new ...It went GA last ...novemebr 2020

but I ahppen to try it recently and wanted to share my experiences so here we go...
